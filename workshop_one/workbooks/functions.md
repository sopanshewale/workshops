# Functions 

Always consider returning generators instead of list. 

Functions are a convenient way to divide your code into useful blocks, allowing us to order our code,
make it more readable, reuse it and save some time. Also functions are a key way to define interfaces
so programmers can share their code.

We have seen many functions till now. 

```
int
type
print

```

## Developing new functions 

Example of Function 

```

```

The first line of the function definition is called the header; the rest is called the body. 
The header has to end with a colon and the body has to be indented.

TODO - how to call a function 

The function definition has to be executed before the first time it is called.

Function definitions do not alter the flow of execution of the program, but remember that statements inside the 
function are not executed until the function is called.

### Parameters and Arguments 

TODO 
Inside the function, the arguments are assigned to variables called parameters.

### Variables and Parameters are Local
TODO 


## Recursions 


## Examples 

### 1. Decimal Number to Binary Number


### 2. Factorial of Number 

### 3. Discuss about Recurssion. Tower of Hanoi


### 4. 


## Assignments 

### 1. Write a function named right_justify that takes a string named s as a parameter and prints the
string with enough leading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 50 of the display.

```
>>> right_justify('Hari Sadu')
                                                      Hari Sadu

```

### 2. Write a function that draws a grid like the following:

```
+----+----+ 
|    |    | 
|    |    | 
|    |    | 
|    |    | 
+----+----+ 
|    |    | 
|    |    | 
|    |    | 
|    |    | 
+----+----+
```
How about using passing function as argument to another function?
